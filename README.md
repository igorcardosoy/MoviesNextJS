First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You need to create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add the following variables:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_TMDB_PUBLIC_KEY=
NEXT_PUBLIC_TMDB_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=https://api.themoviedb.org/3
NEXT_PUBLIC_TMDB_PUBLIC_IMAGE_BASE_URL=https://media.themoviedb.org/t/p/w220_and_h330_bestv2
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=
```

The TMDB API key is from [The Movie Database](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api)
